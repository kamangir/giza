\subsection{Strings of Characters (strings)}
\label{math_strings}

We recognize \emph{strings of characters} as defined in Python~\cite{python_string} and support all string operations. In a \emph{command}~\ref{commands}, the notation \placeholder{descriptive-name} represents a \emph{placeholder} for a string of characters that is described as \emph{descriptive-name}. See~\ref{commands} for examples.
