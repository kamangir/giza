\subsection{Commands \& Expansions}

A command is a string of characters that is meaningful to \emph{Bash}~\cite{gnu_bash}. Bash is a \enquote{Unix shell and command language first released in 1989 that has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions}~\cite{bash}. A shell is a \enquote{macro processor that executes commands}~\cite{bash_manual}, where \enquote{macro processor means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions}~\cite{bash_manual}. There are seven kinds of \emph{expansions}~\cite{bash_expansions_ref} in Bash.
