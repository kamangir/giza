\marginpar{Command Syntax}
We are interested in a special category of valid bash commands~\cite{shell_syntax} that start with a specially--crafted callable, continue with a prescribed sequence of identifiers, and end with arguments. In this convention, the type of each identifier is known based on the command until that identifier, and is one of the following.
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \keyword{value}, either numerical or a filename, for example.
    \item An \emph{options}.
    \item An object name or pointer.
\end{itemize}
%
This is an example command,
%
\begin{verbatim}
vanwatch ingest area=vancouver,~batch,count=5,gif . --count 12
\end{verbatim}
%
Here, ``\keyword{vanwatch}'' is the callable and ``\keyword{ingest}'' is the task, effectively an Enum, which is an \keyword{Options}. The command continues with ``\texttt{area=vancouver,~batch,count=5,gif}'', which is an \keyword{Options}, ``\texttt{.}'', which is an object pointer, and ``\texttt{--count 12}'', which are the arguments.
