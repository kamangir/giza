\marginpar{\keyword{namespaces}}
The Bash function \keyword{<func>} that has received the task \keyword{<task>} could redirect to the function \keyword{<func>\_<task>}. We use this \emph{namespacing}~\cite{namespaces} mechanism for organization as well as orchestration. In practice, this leads to callables with multiple prefixes. We generate `@<keyword>` aliases~\cite{aliases} to facilitate user access.
