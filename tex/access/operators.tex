\marginpar{Operators}
A group of \emph{operators} maintain a growing space of \emph{command}s in a set of repositories, using a system such as \emph{git}~\cite{git} and following a collective peer-reviewed \emph{pull-request}~\cite{pull_request} process. Each operator can access a set of \emph{machines} and create \emph{shells} on them to run commands to produce \emph{objects} which have an implicit or explicit value. The objective of every operator is to increase the quality and quantity of the objects they generate.
