\marginpar{Machines and Shells}
A machine is a state machine that is connected to many other machines and shares some of its state with them for read and write. A shell is a stateful access mechanism to a machine that an operator uses to run commands. Running a command in a shell can potentially modify the state of all other machines. Machines and shells may be restarted through running commands. After a restart, machines and shells maintain some of their state. Two examples of machines are a Raspberry Pi~\cite{rpi} that runs Linux and is connected to the AWS infrastructure~\cite{aws} and a docker container~\cite{docker} running in AWS Batch~\cite{aws_batch}. GNU Bash~\cite{gnu_bash} is an example of a shell.

The operators act asynchronously while communicating with each other. Multiple operators may simultaneously use the same machine, and the same operator may simultaneously use multiple machines. Only one operator uses a shell at one time. Some machines are exogenous to this model, yet the operators can access their states in read or write modes. Cloud storage~\cite{aws_s3} and compute resources~\cite{aws_batch} are examples of these machines.
