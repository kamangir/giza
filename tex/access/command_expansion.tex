\marginpar{Command Expansion}
The Bash function \keyword{<func>} that has received the task \keyword{<task>} calls the function \keyword{<func>\_<task>} with the rest of the command. We use this \emph{namespacing}~\cite{namespaces} mechanism for organization as well as orchestration. In practice, this leads to callables with multiple prefixes. We generate `@<keyword>` aliases~\cite{aliases} to facilitate user access.
