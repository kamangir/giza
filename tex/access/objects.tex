\marginpar{Objects}
Data within the system is accessed as objects. An object is a uniquely named collection of files and folders and can be downloaded or uploaded, in part or as a whole. Some objects already exist in the environment. For example, an item in a STAC collection~\cite{stac_intro_tutorial} (a datacube) or a dataset in kaggle~\cite{chen2019-AIRD-dataset} are objects. A curated dataset, a model trained on it, and the model's predictions on a datacube, are examples of other objects. Some objects are are the outputs of the system, some are used in generating such objects.
