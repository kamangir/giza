This is an attempt to understand \emph{James C. Slife}'s the ``Four A's''~\cite{Slife24}

We first develop a mathematical model to discuss the four As in Section~\ref{theory}. Then, we propose expansions for Access and Automation in Sections~\ref{access} and \ref{automation}, respectively. We briefly review a proposed view of Analytics as Access the outputs of Automation in Section~\ref{analytics}. Finally, in Section~\ref{ai}, we review the implementation of the proposed framework in multiple AI applications.

% yeah we you know we you're hearing it here uh among the vice Chiefs uh we we all tend to go to the uh what I would describe as kind of the four As that we're after uh accessibility when I ask a question I want to be able to access uh access the uh data that allows me to answer the question that I'm asking uh automation our ability to uh uh make routine tasks that are presently done by humans so that they can be done by machines we've we've done this in stove pipes for years uh Admiral Kilby talked about um uh the egis system the egis system has had the ability to operate an air defense system in an automated role uh for decades frankly uh and so this is not a not a new idea uh the third a is analytics we want to be able to generate insights uh that might not otherwise be um obvious to us one of the examples uh that I've used is the amount of uh bus traffic data bus traffic that goes back and forth uh on an aircraft on every single flight uh and at the end of the flight that data bus traffic is largely discarded because it has served its the purpose for which it was designed but if we were to collect that data bus traffic what we might gain is analytic insights into when a part is going to break that allows us to not order parts before we need them but also allows the parts to be available uh so that it doesn't break scheduled maintenance on an aircraft is way uh more efficient than unscheduled maintenance and if you wait for the part to Break by definition you're you're creating unscheduled maintenance for yourself so analytics and then finally the last day is AI and so we we tend to kind of leap to the use cases but the thing that underpins all four of these A's is data and I think General Mingus has got it exactly right we need uh uh common standards we need common uh um uh processes uh it's a it's a cultural problem uh as much as everything else
