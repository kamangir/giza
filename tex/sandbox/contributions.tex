\subsection{Contributions of This Work}\label{contributions}

We proposed several novel Bash expansions based on command substitution~\ref{command_substitution}. Then, using typed positional arguments, we propose \keyword{options} and \keyword{objects}. Then, we discuss argument injection as a suffix~\ref{expansions_param_injection} and \emph{prefixing}~\ref{prefixing} to transform ``\keyword{<command>}'' to ``\keyword{<prefix> <options> <command>}''. 

We proposed the \keyword{@seed}; the notion that code generates code that is transferred into another machine through the clipboard, a key, or a \keyword{scp}~\cite{scp}--style protocol to \keyword{terraform} the machine and run \keyword{commands}.
