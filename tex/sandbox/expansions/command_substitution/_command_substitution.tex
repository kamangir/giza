\subsection{Command Substitution}\label{command_substitution}

During the execution of the command,
%
\begin{verbatim}
<part-1> $(<sub-command>) <part-2>
\end{verbatim}
%
\texttt{<sub-command>} is executed and its outcome, \texttt{<outcome>}, is used to generate the updated command as,
%
\begin{verbatim}
<part-1> <outcome> <part-2>
\end{verbatim}
%
which is then executed~\cite{command_substitution}. Here is an example from \keyword{roofAI},
%
\begin{verbatim}
roofAI semseg predict \
    profile=FULL,upload \
    $(@ref roofAI_semseg_model_AIRS_full_v2) \
    $(@ref roofAI_ingest_AIRS_v2) \
    $(@timestamp)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here, \texttt{@ref <keyword>} reads the value of \texttt{<keyword>} from the \keyword{cache} and \texttt{@timestamp} generates a unique timestamp for use as an \texttt{<object-name>}. Collectively, this command runs the \enquote{Pytorch Segmentation Model}~\cite{smp} that is cached as \texttt{roofAI\_semseg\_model\_AIRS\_full\_v2} on the dataset that is cached as \texttt{roofAI\_ingest\_AIRS\_v2} and uploads the results in a uniquely named \keyword{objects}. Tags and relations are other object metadata relevant to this expansion.

Command substitution is useful for generating the command components through Python or Bash. For example, in the AWS Open Data Registry~\cite{aws_open_data} there is the notion of datasets, such as \texttt{hst}~\cite{hst} for Hubble Space Telescope and the metadata the dataset is maintained in \texttt{yaml} files a git repository~\footnote{\texttt{datasets/hst.yaml}~\cite{aws_open_data}.}. 

For example, here is the command to access \texttt{ibrma2f2q\_drc.jpg} in object \texttt{public/ibrm/ibrma2f2q} in the dataset \texttt{hst},
%
\begin{verbatim}
aws s3 cp \
    $(hubble_get auth $dataset_name) \
    $(hubble_get s3_uri $dataset_name $hubble_object_name)$filename \
    $path
\end{verbatim}
%
where, \texttt{hubble\_get} is a Bash wrapper around a Python call.
%
\begin{verbatim}
function hubble_get() {
    python3 -m hubblescope get \
        --what "$1" \
        --dataset_name "$2" \
        --object_name "$3" \
        "${@:4}"
}
\end{verbatim}
