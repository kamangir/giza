\subsection{Computational Model}\label{computation_model}

A group of operators create and modify a set of \keyword{scripts} maintained in a code repository, such as \keyword{git}. The \keyword{core} and the \keyword{plugins} are also maintained in one or more repositories. Each operator can access a set of machines and create shells on them. Each operator can also access a set of repositories and clone them on the machines where they create shells and receive updates. The operator can modify any of the repositories that they have access to following a collective peer-reviewed \texttt{pull-request}~\cite{pull_request} process.

The operators act asynchronously while communicating with each other. Multiple operators may simultaneously use the same machine, and the same operator may simultaneously use multiple machines. Only one operator uses a shell at one time. 

Some machines are exogenous to this model, yet the operators can access their states in read or write mode. Cloud storage and compute resources are examples of these machines.
