\subsection{Computation Model}
\label{computation_model}

A group of operators attempt to collectively generate states that they define as favourable using multiple machines. The operators act asynchronously while communicating with each other. Multiple operators may simultaneously use the same machine and the same operator may simultaneously use multiple machines. Only one operator uses a shell at one time.

The primary objective of the operator is to generate the commands that produce objects that meet a set of requirements in the future. This is different from generating such objects as an action that concludes. Nevertheless, to develop and validate the commands that produce the objects of interest, the operators produce such objects.
