\subsubsection{Command Templates}
\label{command-template}

Commands can be similar when considered as strings of characters. Here is a command that is similar to the above,
%
\begin{verbatim}
vanwatch ingest toronto upload . --count 3
\end{verbatim}
%
A \emph{command template} is a representation that yields similar commands, given the following rules. First, \placeholder{description} can be replaced with any string of characters that can be described as ``description''. See \emph{objects}~\ref{objects}, \emph{options}~\ref{options}, and \emph{arguments}~\ref{arguments}, for the next rules. Here is a command template for the two above,
%
\begin{verbatim}
vanwatch ingest \
    <area> \
    [dryrun,~upload] \
    [<object-name>] \
    [--count <-1>]
\end{verbatim}
