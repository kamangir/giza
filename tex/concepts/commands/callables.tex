\subsubsection{Callables}
\label{callables}

A \emph{callable} is a valid command with no space and control operators~\footurl{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html\#index-control-operator}. The list of callables depends on the machine's state and is generally extended through terraforming. Some of the well-known callables are \emph{git}~\footurl{https://git-scm.com/docs/git}, \emph{docker}~\footurl{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/}, \emph{pushd}~\footurl{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html\#Directory-Stack-Builtins}, \emph{nano}~\footurl{https://www.nano-editor.org/}. 

\begin{theorem}
For any callable \placeholder{callable}, and any string \placeholder{suffix}, ``\placeholder{callable} \placeholder{suffix}'' is a valid command.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For any valid command \placeholder{command}, and any string \placeholder{suffix}, ``\placeholder{command} \placeholder{suffix}'' is a valid command.
\end{theorem}

The \texttt{core}~\ref{core} is a callable. Many plugins~\ref{plugins} define their callable.
