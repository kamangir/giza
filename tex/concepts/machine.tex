\subsection{Machines, Shells, and Terraforming}
\label{machine}

A \emph{machine} is a state machine that is connected to many other machines and shares its state with them. A \emph{shells} is a stateful access mechanism to a machine to run \emph{commands}~\ref{commands}. Running a command in a shell can modify the state of the shell, the machine on which the shell is running, and potentially the states of all other machines. \emph{Terraforming} is the process of running commands that modify the state of the shell and the machine. 

A command may be \emph{invalid}, in which case running it results in a special state change. In bash, for example, the following message is printed,

\begin{verbatim}
-bash: void: command not found
\end{verbatim}

Note that writing to the standard streams \emph{stdin} and \emph{stdout} are examples of state changes in the shell and the machines. 

Two examples of machines are a Raspberry Pi that runs Linux and is connected to AWS~\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/}} and a docker container running in AWS Batch. GNU Bash~\footnote{\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}} is an example of a shell.
