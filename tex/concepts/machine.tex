\subsection{Machines and Shells}
\label{machine}

A \emph{machine} is a state machine that is connected to many other machines and shares some of its state with them for read and write. A \emph{shell} is a stateful access mechanism to a machine that an \emph{operator}~\ref{operator} uses to run \emph{commands}~\ref{commands}. Running a command in a shell can modify the state of the shell, the machine on which the shell is running, and potentially the states of all other machines. 

Machines and shells may be restarted by an operator or by code. After a restart, machines and shells maintain some of their state. 

Two examples of machines are a Raspberry Pi that runs Linux and is connected to AWS~\footnote{\url{https://aws.amazon.com/}} and a docker container running in AWS Batch. GNU Bash~\footnote{\url{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}, \emph{Bash}, \emph{bash}.} is an example of a shell.
