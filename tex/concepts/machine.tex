\subsection{Machines and Shells}
\label{machine}

A \emph{machine} is a state machine that is connected to many other machines and shares its state with them. A \emph{shells} is a stateful access mechanism to a machine to run \emph{commands}~\ref{commands}. Running a command in a shell can modify the state of the shell, the machine on which the shell is running, and potentially the states of all other machines. Terraforming~\ref{terraform} is the process of running commands that modify the state of the shell and the machine to alter the validity and outcome of future commands.

Two examples of machines are a Raspberry Pi~\cite{RaspberryPi} that runs Linux and is connected to AWS~\cite{AWS} and a docker container that is running in AWS Batch~\cite{AWSBatch}. GNU Bash~\cite{bash} is an example of a shell.
