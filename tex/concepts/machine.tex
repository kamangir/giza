A \emph{machine} is a state machine that can run many \emph{shells}~\ref{shell}. The machine is connected to a network of other machines and shares its state with them. Terraforming~\ref{terraform} is the process of running commands that modify the machine's state in ways that alter the validity and outcome of commands~\ref{commands}.

A Raspberry Pi~\cite{RaspberryPi} that is running Linux and is connected to AWS~\cite{AWS} is a machine. A docker container that is running in AWS Batch~\cite{AWSBatch} is also a machine.
