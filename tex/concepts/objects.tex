\subsection{Objects}
\label{objects}

Objects are accessible on every machine by their \emph{name} and an object may be \emph{selected}~\ref{select}. Objects may be uploaded~\ref{upload} and downloaded~\ref{download}, fully or partially, or listed~\ref{list}. Objects have metadata~\ref{object-metadata}.

Commands~\ref{commands} consume and generate objects. If the object name is not provided or is provided as \texttt{-}, then an object with a unique name is created and used. Otherwise, the object is either provided by name, as in \placeholder{object-name}, or by reference, as in one of ``.'', ``..'' or ``...''.
