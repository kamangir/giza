\section{Access}

Actions are performed through \emph{commands}. A command is a string of characters that is meaningful to Bash~\cite{gnu_bash}. 

While there are exceptions, commands generally consume and generate data as \emph{objects}. An objects is a uniquely named collection of files and folders and can be downloaded or uploaded, in part or as a whole.
