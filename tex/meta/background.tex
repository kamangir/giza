\section{Background and Context}

Almost six years ago, on Thursday, November 8, 2018, I acquired a Raspberry Pi~\footurl{https://www.raspberrypi.org/} on Amazon and since then I have been fascinated by Linux. Professionally, I do AI and, more recently, geospatial AI. In my personal life, I mix AI, cloud, and Mathematics into minimal forms that seek survival~\footurl{https://github.com/kamangir}.

This paper presents the mathematical mechanisms that I use when I build AI systems. This is an effort to better understand these mechanisms to use them more optimally and along novel dimensions.

This paper discusses concepts at the intersection of mathematics, software science, and computer science, and lacks scientific rigour in many places. I hope to receive guidance from experts in the field to solidify the theoretical foundations of this work.
