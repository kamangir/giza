\subsection{Objects}
\label{objects}

Objects are accessible on every machine by their \emph{name}, and an object may be \emph{selected}~\ref{select}. Objects may be uploaded~\ref{upload} and downloaded~\ref{download}, fully or partially, or listed~\ref{list}. Objects have metadata~\ref{metadata}. Commands~\ref{commands} consume and generate objects. If the object name is not provided or is given as \texttt{-}, then an object with a unique name is created and used. Otherwise, the object is either provided by name, as in \texttt{object-name}, or by reference, as in one of \texttt{.}, \texttt{..} or \texttt{...}~\ref{select}. An object points to an S3 bucket~\footurl{https://aws.amazon.com/s3/} and may be typed~\ref{select}. Special variables, such as \texttt{abcli\_object\_name}, \texttt{abcli\_object\_path}, \texttt{abcli\_hubble\_dataset\_object\_name}, \texttt{abcli\_object\_name\_prev2} carry the name of the selected object, its path, the name of current selected hubble dataset and the second previous selected object, respectively.
