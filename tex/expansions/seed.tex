\subsection{\texttt{@seed}}
\label{seed}

It is often necessary to continue the operation on another \keyword{machine}. Examples include \texttt{ssh}ing to another machine, continuing the work on AWS SageMaker and between different images, running the code in a docker container or submitting it to AWS Batch, or running commands inside the Python Console in QGIS~\footurl{https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/python_console.html}. The \texttt{@seed} expansion generates the code for the other machine to terraform and run a command or start accepting commands~\footnote{Does this concept exist in the literature?}.
%
\begin{verbatim}
@seed \
    [<target>|docker|ec2|jetson|headless_rpi|mac|rpi|sagemaker|sagemaker-system] \
    [clipboard|filename=<filename>|key|screen,env=<env-name>,plugin=<plugin-name>,-log]
\end{verbatim}
%
The \texttt{seed} has been transferred through the clipboard, a USB key, and \texttt{scp}. Here is an example,
%
\begin{verbatim}
 > @seed sagemaker screen
seed: abcli-7.2477.1.2023-06-aws-batch-a -sagemaker-> screen
run "bash" before pasting the seed.
#! /bin/bash
echo "abcli-7.2477.1.2023-06-aws-batch-a seed for sagemaker"

pip install --upgrade pip

cd git/awesome-bash-cli
pip3 install -e .

source ./abcli/.abcli/abcli.sh
\end{verbatim}
