\subsection{Command Substitution}
\label{command_substitution}

A symbolic description of command substitution is that if \texttt{<part-1>\$(<sub-command>)<part-2>} is encountered, then \texttt{<sub-command>} is executed and its outcome, \texttt{<outcome}, is used to generate the updated command as \texttt{<part-1><outcome><part-2>}, which is then executed. This process happens numerously and hierarchically~\footurl{https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html\_node/Command-Substitution.html}.

Here is an example from \texttt{roofAI}~\ref{roofAI},
%
\begin{verbatim}
roofAI semseg predict \
    profile=FULL,upload \
    $(@ref roofAI_semseg_model_AIRS_full_v2) \
    $(@ref roofAI_ingest_AIRS_v2) \
    $(@timestamp)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here, \texttt{@ref <keyword>} reads the value of \texttt{<keyword>} from the \texttt{cache}~\ref{cache} and \texttt{@timestamp} generates a unique timestamp for use as an \texttt{<object-name>}. Collectively, this command runs the \enquote{Pytorch Segmentation Model}~\footurl{https://github.com/qubvel/segmentation_models.pytorch} that is cached as \texttt{roofAI_semseg_model_AIRS_full_v2} on the dataset that is cached as \texttt{roofAI_ingest_AIRS_v2} and uploads the results in a uniquely named object~\ref{objects}. Tags~\ref{tags} and relations~\ref{relations} are other object metadata~\ref{metadata} that are relevant to this expansion.

Command substitution is useful for generating the components of the command through Python or Bash. For example, in the AWS Open Data Registry~\footurl{https://registry.opendata.aws/} there is the notion of datasets, such as \texttt{hst}~\footurl{https://registry.opendata.aws/hst/} for Hubble Space Telescope and metadata the dataset is maintained in \texttt{yaml} files a git repository~\footurl{https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry/blob/main/datasets/hst.yaml}. 

For example, here is the command to access \texttt{ibrma2f2q_drc.jpg} in object \texttt{public/ibrm/ibrma2f2q} in the dataset \texttt{hst},
%
\begin{verbatim}
aws s3 cp $auth $s3_uri$filename $path
\end{verbatim}
%
Here, \texttt{\$auth} and \texttt{\$s3\_uri} are generated as,
%
\begin{verbatim}
local auth=$(abcli_hubble_get auth $dataset_name)
local s3_uri=$(abcli_hubble_get s3_uri $dataset_name $hubble_object_name)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here, \texttt{abcli_hubble_get} is a Bash wrapper~\footurl{https://github.com/kamangir/hubble/blob/main/.abcli/hubble.sh#L34} around the Python cli \texttt{hubble/hubble/__main__.py}~\footurl{https://github.com/kamangir/hubble/blob/main/hubble/__main__.py} from \texttt{hubble}~\ref{hubble}.
%
\begin{verbatim}
python3 -m hubble get \
    --what "$1" \
    --dataset_name "$2" \
    --object_name "$3" \
    "${@:4}"
\end{verbatim}
