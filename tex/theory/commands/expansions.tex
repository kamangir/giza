\emph{Brace Expansion}~\cite{brace_expansion} expands `\keyword{a\{d,c,b\}e}' to `\keyword{ade ace abe}'. \emph{Tilde Expansion}~\cite{tilde_expansion} relates to words that begin with an unquoted tilde character (\textasciitilde). \emph{Parameter and Variable Expansion}~\cite{shell_parameter_expansion} enable the use of variables, as \texttt{\$\{variable\}}, as well as more elaborate pattern matching forms such as \texttt{\$\{parameter/\#pattern/string\}}. \emph{Command Substitution} \enquote{allows the output of a command to replace the command itself} ~\cite{command_substitution}. \emph{Arithmetic expansion}~\cite{arithmetic_expansion} enables arithmetic operations using the form \texttt{\$(( expression ))} and \emph{Word Splitting}~\cite{word_splitting} governs the splitting of the command to words. Finally, \emph{Filename Expansion}~\cite{filename_expansion} enables the familiar wildcard reference to filenames using `*' and `?'.
