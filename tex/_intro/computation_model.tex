\subsection{Computational Model}\label{computation_model}\label{operator}\label{operators}

A group of \emph{operators} create and maintain the \keyword{core} and the \keyword{plugins} as one or more repositories, using a system such as \keyword{git} and following a collective peer-reviewed \emph{pull-request}~\cite{pull_request} process. Each operator can access a set of \keyword{machines} and create \keyword{shells} on them to run \keyword{commands}. Each \emph{operator} attempts to maximize an objective function that depends on the state of multiple machines.

The operators act asynchronously while communicating with each other. Multiple operators may simultaneously use the same machine, and the same operator may simultaneously use multiple machines. Only one operator uses a shell at one time. 

Some machines are exogenous to this model, yet the operators can access their states in read or write modes. Cloud storage~\cite{aws_s3} and compute resources~\cite{aws_batch} are examples of these machines.
