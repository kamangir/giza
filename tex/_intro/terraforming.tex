\subsection{Terraforming}\label{terraform}\label{terraforms}\label{terraforming}

\emph{Terraforming} is the process of running \keyword{commands} that modify the state of the \keyword{shell} and the \keyword{machine} in ways that make additional commands found. Terraforming is also intended to modify the state change caused by a set of commands favourable to the interests of an \keyword{operator}. Terraforming also ensures the states of the machine and the shell after a restart. Terraforming generally includes a modification of \emph{bashrc}, \emph{bash\_profile}, \emph{screenrc}, and \emph{desktop} files.
