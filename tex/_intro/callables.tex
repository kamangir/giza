\subsubsection{Callables}\label{callables}\label{callable}

A \emph{callable} is a valid command with no space and control operators~\cite{control_operators}. The list of callables depends on the state of the \keyword{machine} and is generally extended through \keyword{terraforming}. Some of the well-known callables are \emph{git}~\cite{git}, \emph{docker}~\cite{docker}, \emph{pushd}~\cite{pushd}, and \emph{nano}~\cite{nano}. 

\begin{theorem}
For any callable \texttt{<callable>}, and any string \texttt{<suffix>}, \texttt{<callable> <suffix>} is a valid command.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
For any valid command \texttt{<command>}, and any string \texttt{<suffix>}, \texttt{<command> <suffix>} is a valid command.
\end{theorem}

The \keyword{core} is a callable. Many \keyword{plugins} define their callable.
