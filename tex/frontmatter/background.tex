\section*{background}

Almost five years ago, on Thursday, November 8, 2018, I acquired a Raspberry Pi on Amazon. Since then, my personal and professional lives have focused on Linux. Professionally, I do AI and, more recently, geospatial AI. In my personal life, I mix AI, cloud, and mathematics into minimal forms that seek survival, see more at \url{https://github.com/kamangir}. Over the years I have built a set of mechanisms for building AI systems~\cite{abcli} that I will document in this paper. Therefore, this is an attempt to produce formal mathematical definitions for the AI mechanisms that I will collectively refer to as \emph{giza}. I seek to better understand these mechanisms through this effort. Moreover, a better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to more optimal use of and expansion of them.
