\marginpar{Terraforming}
\emph{Terraforming} is the process of installing modules and adjusting the configuration of a shell or a machine for a specific purpose through running a series of commands. These commands are often long and unintuitive and contain secrets and other environment variables. Terraforming is generally persistent and has to be done once at the first use of a machine. Examples include \keyword{ssh} into a new machine, starting a machine on a service such as AWS SageMaker~\cite{sagemaker}, and running commands inside the Python Console in \emph{QGIS}~\cite{QGIS_python_console}. The \emph{seed expansion} generates the code required for terraforming a target and transfers it through one of the listed mechanisms,
