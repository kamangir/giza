\marginpar{Cascading Options}
In practice, there is often a series of commands that generate a cascade of objects that contains the final products. Each command in this series has one or more options and takes in and produces zero or more objects. Here is a representative case,
%
\begin{verbatim}
vanwatch \
    ingest \
    target=<target>,count=<count> \
    $object_name

vanwatch \
    detect \
    count=<count>,gif,model=<model-id>,publish \
    $object_name \
    --overwrite 1
\end{verbatim}
%
The \emph{options cascade expansion} compresses this cascade of commands as follows,
%
\begin{verbatim}
vanwatch \
    ingest \
    target=<target>,count=<count> \
    $object_name \
    detect,count=<count>,gif,model=<model-id>,publish \
    --overwrite 1
\end{verbatim}
