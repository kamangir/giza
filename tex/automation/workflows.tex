\marginpar{\keyword{workflows}}
A \keyword{workflow} is a set of commands that depend on each other because they consume objects that are generated by other commands, among other reasons. We model a workflow as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each node is a command. We use this abstraction to run workflows on AWS Batch~\cite{aws_batch} and Argo Workflows~\cite{argoflow}.
