% Access, Automation, Analytics -> AI

Unrestricted \emph{Access} to algo and data is essential to augment the limited cognitive capabilities of humans, enabling the construction of vast systems that expand beyond the horizon. These large-scale systems are often developed by individuals who may never meet or might even be antagonistic due to local office dynamics. The next desires are \emph{Automation}, to enable linear descriptions of exponentially-expanding complexity, and \emph{Analytics}, to compress the resulting volumes of information into the bandwidth of human operators for effective consumption.

This paper proposes a mathematical framework to achieve Access, Automation, and Analytics through building a custom language for the context. This model, for the sake of demonstration, is comparable to fitting the spanning tree of an Application Programming Interface (API)~\cite{fielding2000rest} to a dataset of use of digital tools by operators recorded as sequences of keystrokes and mouse clicks. We propose a mathematical framework for discussing this category of languages and provide a reference implementation~\cite{abcli} based on \emph{Bash}~\cite{gnu_bash} expansions that call into \emph{Python}~\cite{python}. We note that Access, Automation, and Analytics have been suggested as the precursors of AI~\cite{Slife24}.

We use AWS SageMaker~\cite{sagemaker} for development and training and AWS Batch~\cite{aws_batch} for inference and compute~\footnote{built by \texttt{gizai-\revision}.}.
