# giza

`giza` is a mathematical model for a production environment for machine vision models and [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) experimentation in python and bash. [`awesome-bash-cli`](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli) (`abcli`) is one implementation of this model. 

We describe machine vision application as a human-readable paragraph, such as "take this, run that, produce those," within the context of a set of machine vision applications in which a particular organization is interested. Through observation, one can produce a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) for the said organization, as follows.

To start type in,

```bash
abcli select
giza digest all
```
