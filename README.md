# giza

`giza` is a mathematical model for a production environment for machine vision models and [reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) experimentation in python and bash. This model is implemented as [`awesome-bash-cli`](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli) (`abcli`) and its [plugins](https://github.com/kamangir/blue-plugin) and other attributes. `giza` and `abcli` are simultensouly under development.

A machine vision application is first described as a human-readable paragraph: "take this, run that, produce those" and is always defined within the context of set of machine vision applications that a certain organization is interested in. Through observation one can produce a [minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree), as follows.
