# The Core

The core loads every other [plugin](plugins.md) and terraforms the machine. The core also provides the basic [commands](../commands.md) to work with [objects](objects.md).

## Example Implementation

[awesome-bash-cli](https://github.com/kamangir/awesome-bash-cli) is an implementation of [Giza](../README.md) with the core `abcli`, or `abc` for short.
